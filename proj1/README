		    Worth: 100 points (10% of course grade)
		      Assigned: Monday, Jan 14, 2013
		      Due: 1:00 pm, Monday, Feb 11, 2013

1. Purpose
-----------

This project is intended to help you understand the instructions of a very
simple assembly language and how to assemble programs into machine language.

2. Problem
-----------

This project has three parts.  In the first part, you will write a program to
take an assembly-language program and produce the corresponding machine
language.  In the second part, you will write a behavioral simulator for the
resulting machine code.  In the third part, you will write a short
assembly-language program to multiply two numbers.

3. LC3101 Instruction-Set Architecture
-----------

For this project, you will be developing a simulator and assembler for the
LC3101 (Little Computer, used in CDA 3101). The LC3101 is very simple, but
it is general enough to solve complex problems. For this project, you will
only need to know the instruction set and instruction format of the LC3101.

The LC3101 is an 8-register, 32-bit computer.  All addresses are
word-addresses (unline MIPS which is byte-addressed).  The LC3101 has 65536
words of memory.  By assembly-language convention, register 0 will always
contain 0 (i.e. the machine will not enforce this, but no assembly-language
program should ever change register 0 from its initial value of 0).

There are 3 instruction formats (bit 0 is the least-significant bit).  Bits
31-25 are unused for all instructions, and should always be 0.
```
R-type instructions (add, nand):
    bits 24-22: opcode
    bits 21-19: reg A
    bits 18-16: reg B
    bits 15-3:  unused (should all be 0)
    bits 2-0:   destReg

I-type instructions (lw, sw, beq):
    bits 24-22: opcode
    bits 21-19: reg A
    bits 18-16: reg B
    bits 15-0:  offsetField (16-bit, range of -32768 to 32767)

O-type instructions (halt, noop):
    bits 24-22: opcode
    bits 21-0:  unused (should all be 0)
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table 1: Description of Machine Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assembly language 	Opcode in binary		Action
name for instruction	(bits 24, 23, 22)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add (R-type format)	000 			add contents of regA with
						contents of regB, store
						results in destReg.

nand (R-type format)	001			nand contents of regA with
						contents of regB, store
						results in destReg.

lw (I-type format)	010			load regB from memory. Memory
						address is formed by adding
						offsetField with the contents of
						regA.

sw (I-type format)	011			store regB into memory. Memory
						address is formed by adding
						offsetField with the contents of
						regA.

beq (I-type format)	100			if the contents of regA and
						regB are the same, then branch
						to the address PC+1+offsetField,
						where PC is the address of the
						beq instruction.

cmov (R-type)	 	101			copy the value regA into destReg
						if the contents of regB != 0
						

halt (O-type format)	110			increment the PC (as with all
						instructions), then halt the
						machine (let the simulator
						notice that the machine
						halted).

noop (O-type format)	111			do nothing except increment PC.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. LC3101 Assembly Language and Assembler (40%)
-----------

The first part of this project is to write a program to take an
assembly-language program and translate it into machine language. You will
translate assembly-language names for instructions, such as beq, into their
numeric equivalent (e.g. 100), and you will translate symbolic names for
addresses into numeric values. The final output will be a series of 32-bit
instructions (instruction bits 31-25 are always 0).

The format for a line of assembly code is:

`label  instruction  field0  field1  field2  comments`

The leftmost field on a line is the label field.  Valid labels contain a
maximum of 6 characters and can consist of letters and numbers (but must start
with a letter). The label is optional (the white space following the label
field is required).  Labels make it much easier to write assembly-language
programs, since otherwise you would need to modify all address fields each time
you added a line to your assembly-language program!

After the optional label is white space which consists of any number of space
or tab characters.  The writespace is followed by the instruction field,
where the instruction can be any of the assembly-language instruction names
listed in the above table.  After more white space comes a series of fields.
All fields are given as decimal numbers or labels.  The number of fields
depends on the instruction, and unused fields should be ignored (treat them
like comments).

    R-type instructions (add, nand) instructions require 3 fields: field0
    is regA, field1 is regB, and field2 is destReg.

    I-type instructions (lw, sw, beq) require 3 fields: field0 is regA, field1
    is regB, and field2 is either a numeric value for offsetField or a symbolic
    address.  Numeric offsetFields can be positive or negative; symbolic
    addresses are discussed below.

    O-type instructions (noop and halt) require no fields.

Symbolic addresses refer to labels.  For lw or sw instructions, the assembler
should compute offsetField to be equal to the address of the label.  This could
be used with a zero base register to refer to the label, or could be used with
a non-zero base register to index into an array starting at the label.  For beq
instructions, the assembler should translate the label into the numeric
offsetField needed to branch to that label.

After the last used field comes more white space, then any comments.  The
comment field ends at the end of a line.  Comments are vital to creating
understandable assembly-language programs, because the instructions themselves
are rather cryptic.

In addition to LC3101 instructions, an assembly-language program may contain
directions for the assembler. The only assembler directive we will use is .fill
(note the leading period). .fill tells the assembler to put a number into the
place where the instruction would normally be stored. .fill instructions use
one field, which can be either a numeric value or a symbolic address.  For
example, ".fill 32" puts the value 32 where the instruction would normally be
stored.  .fill with a symbolic address will store the address of the label.
In the example below, ".fill start" will store the value 2, because the label
"start" is at address 2.

The assembler should make two passes over the assembly-language program. In the
first pass, it will calculate the address for every symbolic label.  Assume
that the first instruction is at address 0.  In the second pass, it will
generate a machine-language instruction (in decimal) for each line of assembly
language.  For example, here is an assembly-language program (that counts down
from 5, stopping when it hits 0).
```
	lw	0	1	five	load reg1 with 5 (uses symbolic address)
	lw	1	2	3	load reg2 with -1 (uses numeric address)
start	add	1	2	1	decrement reg1
	beq	0	1	2	goto end of program when reg1==0
	beq	0	0	start	go back to the beginning of the loop
	noop
done	halt				end of program
five	.fill	5
neg1	.fill	-1
stAddr	.fill	start			will contain the address of start (2)
```
And here is the corresponding machine language:
```
(address 0): 8454151 (hex 0x810007)
(address 1): 9043971 (hex 0x8a0003)
(address 2): 655361 (hex 0xa0001)
(address 3): 16842754 (hex 0x1010002)
(address 4): 16842749 (hex 0x100fffd)
(address 5): 29360128 (hex 0x1c00000)
(address 6): 25165824 (hex 0x1800000)
(address 7): 5 (hex 0x5)
(address 8): -1 (hex 0xffffffff)
(address 9): 2 (hex 0x2)
```
Be sure you understand how the above assembly-language program got translated
to machine language.

Since your programs will always start at address 0, your program should only
output the contents, not the addresses.

4.1. Running Your Assembler
-----------

Write your program to take two command-line arguments.  The first argument is
the file name where the assembly-language program is stored, and the second
argument is the file name where the output (the machine-code) is written.
For example, with a program name of "assemble", an assembly-language program
in "program.as", the following would generate a machine-code file "program.mc":
    
`    assemble program.as program.mc`

Note that the format for running the command must use command-line arguments
for the file names (rather than standard input and standard output).  Your
program should store only the list of decimal numbers in the machine-code
file, one instruction per line.  Any deviation from this format (e.g. extra
spaces or empty lines) will render your machine-code file ungradable.  Any
other output that you want the program to generate (e.g. debugging output) can
be printed to standard output.

4.2. Error Checking
-----------

Your assembler should catch the following errors in the assembly-language
program: use of undefined labels, duplicate labels, offsetFields that don't fit
in 16 bits, and unrecognized opcodes.  Your assembler should exit(1) if it
detects an error and exit(0) if it finishes without detecting any errors.  Your
assembler should NOT catch simulation-time errors, i.e. errors that would occur
at the time the assembly-language program executes (e.g. branching to address
-1, infinite loops, etc.).

4.3. Test Cases
-----------

An integral (and graded) part of writing your assembler will be to write a
suite of test cases to validate any LC3101 assembler.  This is common practice
in the real world--software companies maintain a suite of test cases for their
programs and use this suite to check the program's correctness after a change.
Writing a comprehensive suite of test cases will deepen your understanding of
the project specification and your program, and it will help you a lot as you
debug your program.

The test cases for the assembler part of this project will be short
assembly-language programs that serve as input to an assembler.  You will
submit your suite of test cases together with your assembler, and we will grade
your test suite according to how thoroughly it exercises an assembler.  Each
test case may be at most 50 lines long, and your test suite may contain up to
20 test cases.  These limits are much larger than needed for full credit (the
solution test suite is composed of 5 test cases, each < 10 lines long).  See
Section 7 for how your test suite will be graded.

Hints: the example assembly-language program above is a good case to include
in your test suite, though you'll need to write more test cases to get full
credit.  Remember to create some test cases that test the ability of an
assembler to check for the errors in Section 4.2.

4.4. Assembler Hints
-----------

Since offsetField is a 2's complement number, it can only store numbers ranging
from -32768 to 32767.  For symbolic addresses, your assembler will compute
offsetField so that the instruction refers to the correct label.

Remember that offsetField is only an 16-bit 2's complement number.  Since most
machines you run your assembler on have 32-bit or 64-bit integers, you will
have to truncate all but the lowest 16 bits for negative values of offsetField.

5. Behavioral Simulator (40%)
-----------

The second part of this assignment is to write a program that can simulate any
legal LC3101 machine-code program.  The input for this part will be the
machine-code file that you created with your assembler.  With a program name
of "simulate" and a machine-code file of "program.mc", your program should be
run as follows:

`    simulate program.mc > output`

This directs all print statements to the file "output".

The simulator should begin by initializing all registers and the program
counter to 0.  The simulator will then simulate the program until the program
executes a halt.

The simulator should call printState (included below) before executing each
instruction and once just before exiting the program.  This function prints the
current state of the machine (program counter, registers, memory).  printState
will print the memory contents for memory locations defined in the machine-code
file (addresses 0-9 in the Section 4 example).

5.1 Test Cases
-----------

As with the assembler, you will write a suite of test cases to validate the
LC3101 simulator.

The test cases for the simulator part of this project will be short
assembly-language programs that, after being assembled into machine code, serve
as input to a simulator.  You will submit your suite of test cases together
with your simulator, and we will grade your test suite according to how
thoroughly it exercises an LC3101 simulator.  Each test case may execute at
most 200 instructions on a correct simulator, and your test suite may contain
up to 20 test cases.  These limits are much larger than needed for full credit
(the solution test suite is composed of a couple test cases, each executing
less than 40 instructions).  See Section 7 for how your test suite will be
graded.

5.2. Simulator Hints
-----------

Be careful how you handle offsetField for lw, sw, and beq. Remember that it's
a 2's complement 16-bit number, so you need to convert a negative offsetField
to a negative 32-bit integer on the Sun workstations (by sign extending it).
To do this, use the following function.
```c
    int
    convertNum(int num)
    {
	/* convert a 16-bit number into a 32-bit Sun integer */
	if (num & (1<<15) ) {
	    num -= (1<<16);
	}
	return(num);
    }
```

An example run of the simulator (not for the specified task of multiplication)
is included at the end of this posting.

6. Assembly-Language Multiplication (20%)

The third part of this assignment is to write an assembly-language program to
multiply two numbers.  Input the numbers by reading memory locations called
"mcand" and "mplier".  The result should be stored in register 1 when the
program halts.  You may assume that the two input numbers are at most 15 bits
and are positive; this ensures that the (positive) result fits in an LC3101
word.  See the algorithm on page 252 of the textbook for how to multiply.
Remember that shifting left by one bit is the same as adding the number to
itself.  Given the LC3101 instruction set, it's easiest to modify the
algorithm so that you avoid the right shift.  Submit a version of the program
that computes (32766 * 10383).

Your multiplication program must be reasonably efficient--it must be at most
50 lines long and execute at most 1000 instructions for any valid numbers (this
is several times longer and slower than the solution).  To achieve this, you
must use a loop and shift algorithm to perform the multiplication; algorithms
such as successive addition (e.g. multiplying 5 * 6 by adding 5 six times)
will take too long.

7. Grading and Formatting
-----------

We will grade primarily on functionality, including error handling, correctly
assembling and simulating all instructions, input and output format, method of
executing your program, correctly multiplying, and comprehensiveness of the
test suites.

The best way to debug your program is to generate your own test cases, figure
out the correct answers, and compare your program's output to the correct
answers.  This is also one of the best ways to learn the concepts in the
project.

The student suite of test cases for the assembler and simulator parts of this
project will be graded according to how thoroughly they test an LC3101
assembler or simulator.  We will judge thoroughness of the test suite by how
well it exposes potentially bugs in an assembler or simulator.

For the assembler test suite, we will use each test case as input to a set
of buggy assemblers.  A test case exposes a buggy assembler by causing it
to generate a different answer from a correct assembler.  The test suite
is graded based on how many of the buggy assemblers were exposed by at
least one test case.  This is known as "mutation testing" in the research
literature on automated testing.

For the simulator test suite, we will correctly assemble each test case,
then use it as input to a set of buggy simulators.  A test case exposes a
buggy simulator by causing it to generate a different answer from a
correct simulator.  The test suite is graded based on how many of the buggy
simulators were exposed by at least one test case.

8. Turning in the Project
-----------

Submit you files through blackboard.
Each part should be archived in a .tar or .zip file to help with grading. 

Here are the files you should submit for each project part:
    1) assembler (part 1a)
        a. C/C++ program for your assembler
	b. suite of test cases (each test case is an assembly-language program
	    in a separate file)

    2) simulator (part 1s)
        a. C/C++ program for your simulator
	b. suite of test cases (each test case is an assembly-language program
	    in a separate file)

    3) multiplication (part 1m)
	a. assembly program for multiplication

Your assembler and simulator must each be in a single C or C++ file.  We will compile
your program on linprog using "gcc program.c -lm" (or g++), so your program
should not require additional compiler flags or libraries.

The official time of submission for your project will be the time the last file
is sent. If you send in anything after the due date, your project will be
considered late (and will use up your late days or will receive a zero).

9. Code Fragment for Assembler
-----------

The focus of this class is machine organization, not C programming skills.  To
"build" your computer, however, you will be doing a lot of C programming.  To
help you, here is a fragment of the C program for the assembler.  This shows
how to specify command-line arguments to the program (via argc and argv), how
to parse the assembly-language file, etc..  This fragment is provided strictly
to help you, though it may take a bit for you to understand and use the file.
You may also choose to not use this fragment.
```c

10. Code Fragment for Simulator
-----------

Here is some C code that may help you write the simulator.  Again, you should
take this merely as a hint.  You may have to re-code this to make it do exactly
what you want, but this should help you get started.  Remember not to
change stateStruct or printState.
```c
/* instruction-level simulator for LC3101 */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define NUMMEMORY 65536 /* maximum number of words in memory */
#define NUMREGS 8 /* number of machine registers */
#define MAXLINELENGTH 1000

typedef struct stateStruct {
    int pc;
    int mem[NUMMEMORY];
    int reg[NUMREGS];
    int numMemory;
} stateType;

void printState(stateType *);

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char line[MAXLINELENGTH];
    stateType state;
    FILE *filePtr;

    if (argc != 2) {
	printf("error: usage: %s <machine-code file>\n", argv[0]);
	exit(1);
    }

    filePtr = fopen(argv[1], "r");
    if (filePtr == NULL) {
	printf("error: can't open file %s", argv[1]);
	perror("fopen");
	exit(1);
    }

    /* read in the entire machine-code file into memory */
    for (state.numMemory = 0; fgets(line, MAXLINELENGTH, filePtr) != NULL;
	state.numMemory++) {
	if (sscanf(line, "%d", state.mem+state.numMemory) != 1) {
	    printf("error in reading address %d\n", state.numMemory);
	    exit(1);
	}
	printf("memory[%d]=%d\n", state.numMemory, state.mem[state.numMemory]);
    }

    return(0);
}

void
printState(stateType *statePtr)
{
    int i;
    printf("\n@@@\nstate:\n");
    printf("\tpc %d\n", statePtr->pc);
    printf("\tmemory:\n");
	for (i=0; i<statePtr->numMemory; i++) {
	    printf("\t\tmem[ %d ] %d\n", i, statePtr->mem[i]);
	}
    printf("\tregisters:\n");
	for (i=0; i<NUMREGS; i++) {
	    printf("\t\treg[ %d ] %d\n", i, statePtr->reg[i]);
	}
    printf("end state\n");
}
```

11. Programming Tips
-----------

Here are a few programming tips for writing C/C++ programs to manipulate bits:

1) To indicate a hexadecimal constant in, precede the number by 0x. For
example, 27 decimal is 0x1b in hexadecimal.

2) The value of the expression (a >> b) is the number "a" shifted right by "b"
bits. Neither a nor b are changed. E.g. (25 >> 2) is 6. Note that 25 is 11001 in
binary, and 6 is 110 in binary.

3) The value of the expression (a << b) is the number "a" shifted left by "b"
bits. Neither a nor b are changed. E.g. (25 << 2) is 100. Note that 25 is 11001
in binary, and 100 is 1100100 in binary.

4) To find the value of the expression (a & b), perform a logical AND on each
bit of a and b (i.e. bit 31 of a ANDED with bit 31 of b, bit 30 of a ANDED with
bit 30 of b, etc.). E.g.  (25 & 11) is 9, since:

    11001 (binary) 
  & 01011 (binary)
---------------------
 =  01001 (binary), which is 9 decimal.

5) To find the value of the expression (a | b), perform a logical OR on each bit
of a and b (i.e. bit 31 of a ORED with bit 31 of b, bit 30 of a ORED with bit 30
of b, etc.). E.g.  (25 | 11) is 27, since:

    11001 (binary) 
  & 01011 (binary)
---------------------
 =  11011 (binary), which is 27 decimal.

6) ~a is the bit-wise complement of a (a is not changed).

Use these operations to create and manipulate machine-code. E.g. to look at bit
3 of the variable a, you might do: (a>>3) & 0x1. To look at bits (bits 15-12) of
a 16-bit word, you could do: (a>>12) & 0xF. To put a 6 into bits 5-3 and a 3
into bits 2-1, you could do: (6<<3) | (3<<1). If you're not sure what an
operation is doing, print some intermediate results to help you debug.
